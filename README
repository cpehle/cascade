3. Building and Running
   --------------------

Build descore:

$ cd src/descore
$ make

Build Cascade without support for Verilog co-simulation:

$ cd src/cascade
$ make

Build Cascade with support for Verilog co-simulation:

$ cd src/cascade
$ make verilog

Build and run life example (will automatically build descore and Cascade):

$ cd examples/life
$ make
$ life

Build and run adder_verilog example (will automatically build descore and Cascade):

$ cd examples/adder_verilog
$ make
$ simv
